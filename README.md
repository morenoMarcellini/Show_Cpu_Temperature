# Show_Cpu_Temperature

Example of code using Xlib and a few of XExtension.

This code produces a simple window which is regularly updates and show the temperature of the cpu #0 (it is easy reconfigurable to show all the cpus available on the pc).

It is heavily commented and makes use of several #if #else #endif to show different paths to create the same effect.

Enjoy.
